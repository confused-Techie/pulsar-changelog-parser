# Pulsar Changelog Specification

## 1.0.0

The Pulsar Changelog specification was defined to allow easy communication, within a single changelog,
many changes across codebases. Allowing a single point of access for what changes have occurred
in multiple modules when there is a single versioning utilized.

This was especially helpful within [Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar).
As while the text editor was the only version that really mattered, we had wanted to be able to easily
track and communicate changes that occurred within every package and module the editor uses and exposed.
